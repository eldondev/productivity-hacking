Mergestone Hackday productivity hacking

Mergestone is having a hackday!

@eldondev and @mmarkey3 are trying to make new things that motivate, gamify,
and generally make working fun, rewarding and iterative.

Suggestions
===============
* Find pull requests that don't have a jira

@eldondev plans
===============
* Check out the hipchat api
* Get pull requests we chat out of the hipchat api
* Get other urls out of the hipchat api
* track jira mentions in the hipchat api 
* * rank top 5 jiras by popularity over the week

@mamarkey3 plans
